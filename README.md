# Marketingâ€“Driven Sales Forecasting	


## Introduction
Understanding consumer behavior is the key to success in the world of business. In this project, we analyze sales data of a product, focusing on understanding the impact of various marketing strategies and promotional activities such as radio advertisements, in-store promotions, discounts, television campaigns, stock availability, and online advertising on sales volume. By employing advanced analytical techniques, including Multiple Linear Regression and Decision Tree Regression, we aim to decode the underlying dynamics of consumer purchasing behavior and empower businesses with actionable insights.
